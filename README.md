## React Seating Plan Organizer (V1)

The purpose of this app is to organise a group of people into different `Tables`, in a VERY user-friendly manner.

People can be dragged from the `List` on the left to a `Table` on the right (marked with the table number)

The `Add Table` card/button can be used to create a new table, or just simply drag a person from the `List` over the card, and it will create a new table

If you have made a mistake with adding a person to a table, just click on the `Remove Person` button (the red x icon), and that person will be removed from the current table and re-added to the `List`
