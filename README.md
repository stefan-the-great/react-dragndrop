## React Seating Plan Organizer (V1)

> The purpose of this app is to organise a group of people into different `Tables`, in a VERY user-friendly manner

---
### Features
* People can be dragged from the `List` on the left to a `Table` on the right (marked with the table number)

* The `Add Table` card/button can be used to create a new table, or just simply drag a person from the `List` over the card, and it will create a new table

* If you have made a mistake with adding a person to a table, just click on the `Remove Person` button (the red x icon), and that person will be removed from the current table and re-added to the `List`

* The `Save` button will display the contents of all the table in the console
    * I hope to develop this button to do two things
        * Save the seating plan data into a database or similar
        * Allow for a text file or PDF to be downloaded with the generated seating plan


### Reason
> I created this because there is a very important wedding coming up, which I am a part of, and we've faced a bit of a road bump with the seating arrangement part of things.

> That is why the `Cards` are called `Tables` instead.

> I hope to develop a backend to this part, as well as to build an entire suite of tools to make wedding planning easier
